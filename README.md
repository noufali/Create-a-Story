# Create-a-Story
 
My project highlights the idea that words or "creativity" simply borrows from what already exist. Create-a-Story presents a passage from 'Sula', a book by Toni Morrison which you are able to "scramble". Once scrambled, words are scattered everywhere throughout the page, appearing like fridge magnets. You can then drag and drop each word onto a line in order to form a sentence. 

Hence, a new beautiful story is created and borrowd from Morrison's beautiful words. To share this story, you would be able to text it to whomever you want (currently only texts my number due to my Twilio account).
